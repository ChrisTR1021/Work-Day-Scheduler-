# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This is my workday scheduler. The workday scheduler shows the business hours of 9am-5pm and the background changes depending on the time of day. The current day is located at the top of the scheduler and will change depending on the day. The current day should always be accurate. The local storage is working as intended and you can type into any of the day fields and save the text. Below is a screenshot of what it looks like currently. Give it a look.
